# LogiCoach
LogiCoach is (going to be) software for practicing propositional logic proofs. The idea is that it shows the user two propositions and asks them to prove or disprove their equivalence. The user does this by applying _tactics_ (e.g. removing double negations) to one proposition to either transform it into the other or obtain a contradiction.

LogiCoach is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and is inspired by the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof management system.
